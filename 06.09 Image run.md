# Use `RUN` in Dockerfile

1. Run `alpine` image

```console
$ docker container run --rm -it alpine
```

2. Install your favorite CLI text editor e.g. `vim` or `nano` using [apk](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Alpine_Linux_package_management):

```console
$ apk add SOMETHING
```

Check that it works by running it.

3. Prepare and build corresponding Dockerfile as `alpine-dev` image.
4. Run the `alpine-dev` image and check that editor is there and runnable.
