# Create Image from Container Layer

1. Run `alpine` image

```console
$ docker container run --name tmp -it alpine
```

2. Install your favorite CLI text editor e.g. `vim` or `nano` using [apk](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Alpine_Linux_package_management):

```console
$ apk add SOMETHING
```

Check that it works by running it. Exit from container.

3. Create a new image based on your changes:

```console
$ docker container commit -m "Add vim" tmp alpine-dev
$ docker container rm tmp
```

## Practice (continue)

4. Run the `alpine-dev` image and check that editor is there and runnable.

```console
$ docker container --rm -it alpine-dev
$ vim
$ exit
```

5. Clean up:

```console
$ docker image rm alpine-dev
```
