# Use .dockerignore file

1. Create a new directory and change directory into it.
2. Create a directory `temp` and a few files there.
3. Create the Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
FROM busybox
COPY . /data
CMD ls -alR /data
```

4. Build the Dockerfile and run it:

```console
$ docker builder build -t tmp .
$ docker container run --rm tmp
```

You should see the `temp` directory.

5. Create `.dockerignore`:

```text
/temp/
```

6. Build and run image again.
   What's the difference?
   What do you need to do?

7. Check the both outputs for the line:

```text
transferring context: ???B
```

How many bytes were before and became later?
